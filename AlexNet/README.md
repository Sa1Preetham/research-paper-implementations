## Brief Synopsis:
AlexNet, one of the most well known image classification models, was introduced by Alex Krizhevsky et al. in 2012. It revolutionized the field of computer vision by winning the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition challenge (ILSVRC) by a tremendous margin. This architecture was a significant tipping point in the field of image recognition, cementing the power and potential of CNNs for tasks. It also went on to inspire many more innovative architectures such as VGG, ResNet and EfficientNet.
