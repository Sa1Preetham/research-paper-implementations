## Brief Synopsis:
This version of a convolutional neural network tries to solve the problem most image processing models that came before it had: networks that went too deep would lose accuracy. The models, through too many convolutions, would lose the essence of the input image. The Residual Network solves this by pretty much adding the image back into the output of some of the convolution layers, thus preserving the essence of the original image. This enables us to make models that are almost 8x as deep as the models that came before, and with more accurate results.
